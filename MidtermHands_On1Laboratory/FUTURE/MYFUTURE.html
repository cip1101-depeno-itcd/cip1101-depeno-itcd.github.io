    <h1>MY FUTURE</h1>
    <p><blockquote> <a href="../FUTURE/diploma.jpg"><img src="diploma.jpg" class="image" alt="diploma" title="diploma"></a>For now, I really don't have a concrete future plans for myself.
        I never know what decisions I will make tomorrow or the next days.
        But one thing is certain the goal of graduating in college and receiving
        my college degree in Information Technology. What I really want after college
        is to work as a web developer or UI/UX Design. This is what I see to myself in the
        next 5-10 years, it would be a challenging journey but fun is on it's way. Because art really gives the vibes on me when I'm creativly thinking it really excites me to continue it. 
        With that also being a financially stable would really give me freedom to do things I just want everyday. A house or an apartment with my parents is the best thing I would decide for myself
        taking care of them and living the best days of their lives. In addition
        to a college education and a wonderful career, I would like to see myself joining a organization
        particularly that helps and save animals. For me, I really value animals and supporting them is the 
        best decision I would do in the future. I would like to see myself helping this animals and also people
        and it's been my passion to really bring out the best in me when it comes to taking care and spreading kindess
        to everyone.

        Traveling would also be an important part of my future. I would like to go to other places, but first locally then after
        visiting the local spots in the philippines. I would immediately go abroad and explore asia first, so that a similar and countries
        near me would be a great start to learn other people's culture and is a great way to experience other's everyday life. This would
        give me a wonderful memories and a unique experience. But also traveling with my loved ones, is the best traveling experience I can have. 
        Touring around the world and seeing the landmarks of every country is everyone's dream and just like me.

        I hope that every day is an adventure towards to my future it will be full of excitement. I hope my decisions in life would lead me to 
        this future plans but as of now all I can do is focus on the day itself and plan for tomorrow. I can't wait to see what my future has in 
        store for me. Whatever it takes I am grateful for my future, and to enjoy life in the way I want it. To enjoy every challenges adn the joruney towards my future, with pride and 
        compassion. To learn the mistakes for me to achieve the future I want and the future that was set for me.</blockquote></p>
