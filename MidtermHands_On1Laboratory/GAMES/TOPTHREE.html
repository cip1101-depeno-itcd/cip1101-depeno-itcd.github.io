    <p><blockquote> Valorant is the game were I mostly spend my time whenever I'm stressed, bored or want to entertain myself. Playing this game really gives me an both enjoyment and frustration, 
        as I said it also bring frustration but it's still the game I prefer really at this time. Even though I have a low specs and quality laptop, I still continue to play this game
        especially with friends. As seen in the video he is one of my idol in valorant gaming, his in game name is tenZ. He is so good that he became the number one player in the game of 
        valorant, and this really inspired me to play valorant and to learn from the moves, IQ and strategy his using in every match he had. Also now that most of the time I only use my laptop,
        using it for school. This gives me an idea to have also valorant as a game in my laptop so that I have a game that will really release my stress and frustration. For me valorant is not
        just a game, it's a community were you also meet new friends and build a friendship within it. It really helps a lot with this pandemic, you really just communicate or interact through 
        online espeically online games. I also joined some tournaments but unfortunately, I haven't won anything but it's a great experience for me even though with that all pressure. Because
        at the end of the day it's the enjoyment and fun you really chase on playing Valorant.

    <p><blockquote> Mobile Legends, the game I spent most of the late teenage and my senior years. Mobile Legends is really versatile as a 5v5 mobile game, first it's very handy because you can play it anywhere
        you really just need to have a phone and a wifi or data. Mobile Legends is also the biggest moba game in the philippines so it really attracts many people to play, enjoy and really work hard
        to become strong at this game. I also joined a few tournaments, were I also experienced alot from our opponents. I really grind it and there was a time the covid was stil surging but a 
        Mobile Legends tournament was held near my house so I didn't hesitate and joined the tournament but unfortunately it's a defeat. It really bring back memories especially my really close friends
        how we used to play Mobile Legends that it was a routine at night or even at day. The game gives a lesson that you don't have to be toxic in playing, because being toxic is just really a rude 
        way to play also as they say it's just a game and they are right. You just need to enjoy it and play it with friends not too seriously, but it was fun and I also too made a lot of friends and 
        lose some friends with just playing this game.

    <p><blockquote> Graal Era the longest and most hours I played is this game, I started playing this since 2014 up until 2021. As I remember I spent almost 10,000 Hours or more playing this game, this is really
        my comfort game. It was so fun that even the game itself is not very appealing to others, but for me it is the best game I ever had. Where as you see in the video the gameplay of it, a very simple
        gameplay but a meaningful one. I wasted almost 4 to 5 accounts, because either I was hacked or I forgot my email so I ended up with many accounts. But the hours of playing it, this was also my
        income or earning game. I earn 1k-2k weekly depending on the hours I spent on it but it was late 2019 or 2020 were I started earning from this game without investing anything and just through 
        working hard. So hard work really pays of with that I never regretted and still I enjoyed it even I was aiming to get a money. I met a lot of friends like it reached to 30 or more friends were
        we always greet and see each other in game, it was the best memories of a game I had. Now the game is dying it really breaks my heart seeing some of my friends are inactive, especially me because
        for being too busy in school which is the first thing to do rather than playing. But I spent all my teenage years playing this game, so if ever the game dies. It such a great game with such a good
        community were everyone is both friendly and caring. I really thank this game for making my teenage years a wonderful and fun experience.
