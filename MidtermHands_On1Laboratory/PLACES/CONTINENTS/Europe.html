        <p>With its unparalleled history, Rome is the third most visited city in Europe and the fourteenth worldwide. It attracts visitors from all over the world who are impatient to discover 
            the city's impressive monuments and archaeological sites; not to mention its renowned cuisine and its lively atmosphere. When exploring the Colosseum, visitors will easily imagine 
            how the gladiators fought for their life in the arena, cheered by the crowd. In the Circus Maximus, travelers will picture the chariots crashing into each other in order to be first 
            in the race, and in the Roman Forum visualise what the Roman public life was like.</p>

        <p>As you probably already know, Berlin has a deep history. When you visit, take some time to learn about Germany's past as a former Soviet State. Every corner of the city has its own 
            story and was once part of a brutal dictatorship that thankfully came to an end. There are several places in the city where you can get a feel for Berlin's rich history. We recommend 
            the Jewish Museum, The Berlin Wall, The Holocaust Memorial and the Topography of Terror. Here's a little bit more about some of the sights where you can get your dose of history.</p>

        <p>Welcome to Budapest. To put it simply, if you haven't been here, it's time you make plans to do so. The city appeals to many: You can step out of a thermal bath and right into a 
            nightclub (and then back into the bath). In a city that dates back to the Old Stone Age, visiting history buffs can take their pick between Roman, neo-Gothic, Renaissance and Ottoman 
            architecture at sites like Buda Castle and Fisherman's Bastion.</p>

        <p>The capital of France seems to have been designed specifically for the enjoyment of its visitors. Its streets, squares, buildings, gardens and monuments beckon tourists to return, 
            and indeed, many do. Some of the most memorable things to do in Paris include visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe and Notre-Dame Cathedral. During the evening, experiencing 
            one of the legendary Moulin Rouge cabaret shows, strolling through some of the most picturesque neighborhoods, like Montmartre, or climbing the Montparnasse Tower are a must.It is always 
            a good time to visit Paris.</p>

        <p>London is one of the most visited cities in the world, attracting millions of tourists every year thanks to its unique and cosmopolitan feel. Home to the country's seat of government 
            and lung of its economy, London is impossible to describe in words and a visit to the heart of the city is a must to get a sense of its immensity and its friendly and welcoming atmosphere.
            London captivates all, bringing culture, light, colour, diversity and fun to all those that visit the city. It is capable of surprising not only first-timers, but also those who return

        <p>Barcelona contains both the authentically historic and the wildly bizarre. From the scenic trails of the colorful Park Güell to the romantic narrow alleys of Barri Gòtic; from the 
            beachside nightclubs to the city's dozens of sacred churches and architectural marvels, this city by the sea seems to attract all types: the adventurer, the couple, the partier, 
            the culture lover and more with an almost overwhelming variety of things to do. You could stay for a few days, but chances are you'll need a whole week to explore. In Barcelona, even 
            the beach is bustling, but it's really the cosmopolitan city that gets all the attention.</p>
