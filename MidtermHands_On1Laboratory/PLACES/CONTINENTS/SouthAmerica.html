        <p>For wide, open viewpoints that offer views of lakes, tropical forests, golden coastlines, and a sprawling city, there are few places in the world better to go to than Rio de Janeiro. 
            The rocky peaks afford great viewpoints from Christ the Redeemer and the Sugarloaf mountain. To see the city from all angles, head to Pedra da Gavea, Vista Chinesa, and Mirante Dona 
            Marta for different, yet equally spectacular, views.</p>

        <p>Bogotá is the capital of and largest city in Colombia. It is a place of convergence for people from all around the country and is therefore diverse and multicultural. Within this city, 
            the past and present come together.The city is also very green thanks to its parks and the hills that extend along its eastern boundary, dwarfed by their two highest points, Monserrate 
            and Guadalupe. The landscape that the people of Bogotá enjoy daily—the sea of green that makes up the Andes mountain range, rising up in the east—would be nearly impossible to find in 
            any other large city.But Bogotá also has the colors of modern buildings and authentic colonial roof tiles that are a true historical treasure from the colonial era.</p>

        <p>São Paulo is a metropolis of many faces. At the same time it is the most important economic center of Brazil, it is the capital of culture in Latin America; with leisure, knowledge and 
            entertainment offers that match to no other. A typically urban metropolis covered in a vast green area.An innovative and vanguard city that preserves in its architecture, arts and 
            gastronomy a past composed by the mix of over 70 nationalities. And, in parallel to preserving traditions, it keeps itself modern. Tuned in is the correct term to describe it. To know 
            better the city only two things are required: an open mind and the willingness to dive in head first in this city that never sleeps.</p>
