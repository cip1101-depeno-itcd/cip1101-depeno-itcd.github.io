        <p>Sydney the oldest, biggest, and most beautiful of all Australian cities, lies amid a seductive intermingling of land and sea. Glide along the glittering harbor on a ferry, see the 
            white sails of the Opera House gleaming in the sunshine, admire the graceful arch of the Harbour Bridge, and you'll see why this is one of the world's top cities. Sydney still fizzes 
            with the adventurous spirit of its settlers. Climb the harbor bridge, surf the green-barrel breaks at Sydney's golden beaches, or fly over the city on a scenic tour. And the adventures 
            don't end in the city. Wildlife-rich wilderness areas surround the city providing appealing day trip possibilities.</p>

        <p>Ranked the world's most livable city six years in a row and regarded as the “cultural and sporting capital” of Australia, Melbourne is as a diverse as its multicultural heritage. 
            The city hosts numerous international festivals, as well as the most prestigious sporting events in the country and our baristas brew the best cups of coffee you've ever tasted. 
            If that isn't motive enough to book your flight to Melbourne here are a whole list of reasons why you should visit the city at least once. For six years Melbourne has scored highly 
            in stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure.

        <p>A melting pot of picturesque beaches, unspoiled national parks, countless dining options and plenty of adventure for the kids, it's no surprise that the Gold Coast remains one of the 
            most popular holiday destinations in Australia. The Gold Coast's star attraction is its beaches, including the world-renowned stretch of sand at Surfers Paradise. Beyond the beaches, 
            discover laid-back neighbourhoods, a booming culinary scene and the Gold Coast's famous theme parks. And be sure to leave enough time for a trip into the subtropical hinterland for 
            rainforest walks and waterfalls.</p>

        <p>Discover Brisbane, the sun-soaked capital of Queensland. Life in Brisbane revolves around the outdoors. As the capital of Australia's Sunshine State, Brisbane invites you to kick off 
            your shoes, grab your mates and enjoy the food, art and adventure on offer. But it's not just what's inside our city's borders that will tempt you to visit. Our surrounding natural 
            wonders are plentiful, with three sand islands off the neighbouring coast, and the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast both within arm's reach (or around 100km anyway).</p>
