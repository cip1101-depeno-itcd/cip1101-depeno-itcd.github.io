        <p>The concrete jungle that is New York City is not all steel and glass. Bountiful parks are to be found throughout the boroughs and were not just talking about Central Park. 
            At more than three times the size, Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx has waterside golf courses and riding trails. The High Line in Chelsea has installations and open-air art. Meanwhile, 
            Staten Island is home to a state park and a state forest, where hiking trails make you feel miles away from the city streets. Pack a picnic and binoculars and you might just spot a few 
            of the original New Yorkers like bullfrogs, red foxes and wild turkeys.</p>

        <p>Los Angeles is home to some of the USA's best beaches and each one has its own unique character. Venice Beach is one of LA's most known beaches and with its numerous galleries, 
            quirky shops, street performers, Muscle Beach body-builders and more, it's the perfect place for a spot of people watching! Santa Monica is another fantastic LA beach district 
            and its perfect for those who want to chill out in the sun, get active on the beach or maybe do a spot of shopping. Outside of these two beaches though, you can find a whole host 
            of others to visit including Manhattan Beach and Malibu..</p>

        <p>The city is renowned for its natural beauty and cultural diversity. For thousands of years the Coast Salish people have called the area now known as Vancouver home, and their history 
            and cultural traditions, deep respect for nature, and spirituality are all tightly woven into the city's cultural fabric. Top spots for exploration include downtown's Stanley Park, 
            with its old-growth cedar forests surrounded by water views and sandy beaches, and the Granville Island Public Market. Other popular neighbourhoods include the West End, Gastown, 
            Yaletown, and Chinatown.</p>

        <p>For residents of Miami, life must sometimes feel like a full-time vacation. Along Ocean Drive, bright pink and yellow Art Deco buildings pop against the blue backdrop of the 
            Atlantic Ocean. On Calle Ocho, the smell of freshly baked croquetas wafts through the air. Walk past any bar or nightclub and the sound of Latin music blasts onto the streets, 
            turning even an empty parking lot into a salsa dance floor. A destination for culture, art, food and yes, its world-renowned nightlife, there are countless reasons to visit Miami.</p>

        <p>Seattle's laid-back attitude and diverse neighborhoods more than make up for its consistently cloudy weather. Plus, it's home to some of the country's best coffee and a thriving arts 
            scene, plenty of history, culture and when the weather permits some exciting outdoor activities. Surrounded by water (and resting between Puget Sound and Lake Washington), 
            the city's favorite outdoor pursuits include kayaking, hiking, camping and whale watching. Overcast skies rarely stop Seattleites from getting out and exploring the city and it 
            shouldn't stop you either.</p>

        <p>The state's capital city, Honolulu, showcases the island's urban appeal. Nearby you'll find a host of cultural and historic sites, from the ornate Iolani Palace to the austere USS 
            Arizona Memorial at the Pearl Harbor National Memorial. In the nearby Waikiki neighborhood, a skyline of high-rises and resorts contrasts with sprawling white sand beaches. For a 
            taste of rural Hawaii, visit the North Shore. Here, you'll find the most brilliant blue waters and meandering hikes. But those three spots aren't Oahu's only must-see locales. Its 
            top-notch restaurants, vibrant cultural events and wild nightlife further showcase this island as a "Gathering Place" of Hawaiian culture.</p>

    <div class="text">
        <p>This cosmopolitan playground is bursting with things to do. Sightseeing options range from Chicago icons like Millennium Park's sculptures, fountains, gardens and event spaces to 
            awe-inspiring architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright, Frank Gehry, Daniel Burnham and Louis Sullivan. Get above it all on The Ledge, a glass platform on the Skydeck at Willis Tower, 
            or the 360 Chicago Observation Deck on North Michigan Avenue, where the TILT experience leans you out 300 meters above Michigan Avenue. Take in the beautiful cityscape with a stroll 
            along the Chicago Riverwalk, where you can enjoy a waterside meal, sip a drink or set out on an architecture cruise on the Chicago River.</p>
