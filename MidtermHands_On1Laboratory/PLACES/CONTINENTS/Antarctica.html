        <p>Penguins and penguin colonies can be found in many places around Antarctica, but there are a few key locations they're best found. One of the best among them is the emperor penguin 
            colony at Snow Hill Island. In addition, the Antarctic Peninsula is a great place to spot penguins, especially Adélies, gentoos, and chinstraps. In fact, Adélies only live in Antarctica, 
            unlike other penguin species.More great penguin colonies exist farther north, in the sub-Antarctic islands of South Georgia</p>

        <p><br><br><br>It's inarguably lovely to sit on the deck of an ice-strengthened polar vessel or sturdy Zodiac boat and simply watch the procession of glacier fronts, icebergs, and perhaps a few 
            surfacing whales pass your field of vision. But few things get you closer to Antarctica's aquatic attractions than kayaking.In a kayak, you can get away from the noise of the motorized 
            vessels and enjoy the scenery in a pure way, powered only by your paddles i.e., the strength of your own arms.

        <p>If you get the chance to travel the Ross Sea, you are sure to experience one of Antarctica's finest and least-visited attractions.Pendleton Strait is an occasional landing site that, 
            if sea ice allows it, can afford you a visit to the southern tip of Renaud Island. This Antarctic attraction is home to Adélie penguins as well as dazzling blue-white icebergs.The 
            Amundsen Sea is another major Antarctic attraction we visit during our Ross Sea cruises. There you can find emperor penguins, groups of seals lounging on the ice floes, possible orcas 
            (killer whales) and minke whales spouting along the ice edge, and different species of fulmarine petrels.</p>

        <p>Not surprisingly, whales are among the chief attractions in Antarctica.Like penguins, you can see whales in many offshore areas around Antarctica. But also like penguins, there are a 
            few ideal hotspots: Cuverville Island, Danco Island, Petermann Island, and Pléneau Island are all great whale-watching Antarctic attractions. They're also good for gentoo penguins, 
            seals, and skuas.Neko Harbour and Paradise Harbour, iconic Antarctica attractions in themselves, are also great places to spot humpbacks and minkes along with gargantuan glaciers.</p>

        <p>There's really no better way to feel like a real Antarctic explorer than digging a snow dugout, throwing a bivouac bag into it, and flopping down for some good solid sack time.
            There are many polar-perfect places for doing this, but three of our regular haunts are Paradise Bay, Port Lockroy, and Errera Channel.Paradise Bay, located north of Lemaire Strait, 
            could easily have its own entry on this list, as it is one of the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous places in all Antarctica.

        <p>If you haven't noticed already, birds are a big thing in Antarctica. You might even say they're an Antarctic attraction.The species you're likely to see on an Antarctica cruise are 
            too numerous to name in full, but leaving out the previously stated penguins makes it easier.So suffice it to say that your Antarctic cruise might very well acquaint you with multiple 
            species of albatross, gull, tern, skua, petrel, shearwater, cormorant, and sheathbill. Particularly, wandering albatrosses are a common favorite.</p>

        <p>We held this entry back nearer to the end of this list, as Basecamp cruises are adventures you can only have with Oceanwide Expeditions. Also, they represent an almost all-inclusive 
            summary of every outdoor activity you can enjoy in Antarctica.One such activity is mountaineering, a decidedly high-octane Antarctica attraction. Soft-climb options inland of Neumayer 
            Channel are highly popular, as well as climbs on Pléneau & Petermann Islands.</p>
