        <p>Sporty, stylish, stunning, sociableâ€¦ If Cape Town was a person, it would be that Hollywood starlet we all secretly envy. The Mother City is unlike any other destination in Africa: 
            Separated from the rest of the continent by a ring of mountains, Cape Town stands as a glittering, metropolis juxtaposed with one of the world's most breathtaking natural landscapes. 
            But good looks aren't the only thing Cape Town has going for it. You'll fall in love with this city's khaki-colored beaches, rolling vineyards, sizzling cuisine, thriving nightlife, 
            and, of course, the spectacular Table Mountain.</p>

        <p>The largest city in Mozambique is the country's capital Maputo, previously known as Lourenco Marques. The city has avenues of Acacias trees lining them, which forms beautiful shady 
            areas. Maputo is a hub of different cultures, with city life and laid back beach life combining to make an interesting city well worth a visit.  Maputo's architecture has a distinct 
            mediterranean feel to it with its outdoor cafes and waterside setting, this capital is one of Africa's most attractive.</p>

        <p>The desert heat, the noisy streets and the sheer size of Cairo will leave even the most adaptable traveler with a serious case of culture shock. The constant bombardment of street 
            vendors, the inescapable aroma of livestock and the seemingly chaotic way of life will joggle the senses. But be patient. Take some time to relax over a cup of tea, to wander the 
            ancient streets and to watch the sun lower over the mighty Nile River. It won't take long for the city's treasures to reveal themselves.</p>

        <p>Ghana's beating heart probably won't inspire love letters, but you might just grow to like it. The capital's hot, sticky streets are perfumed with sweat, fumes and yesterday's cooking 
            oil. Like balloons waiting to be burst, clouds of dirty humidity linger above stalls selling mangoes, banku (fermented maize meal) and rice. The city's tendrils reach out towards the 
            beach, the center and the west, each one a different Ghanaian experience.</p>

        <p>East Africa's most cosmopolitan city, Nairobi is Kenya's beating heart, an exciting, frenetic concrete jungle that counterpoints the untrammelled natural beauty to be found elsewhere 
            in the country. If you're interested in learning about Kenya's culture and history, the city is home to a number of great stops including the extensive National Museum, and it's also 
            a great jumping off point for diving into the country's varied culinary traditions. Nairobi also harbors a thrumming nightlife scene and an established cafe culture.</p>

        <p>As tourist towns go, Lagos (lah-goosh) has got the lot. The port town, which launched many naval excursions during Portugal's extraordinary Age of Discovery, lies along the bank of 
            the Rio Bensafrim. Its old town's pretty, cobbled lanes and picturesque squares and churches are enclosed by 16th-century walls. Beyond the walls is a modern but not overly unattractive 
            sprawl and some truly fabulous beaches.</p>

    <div class="text">
        <p>Over the last century, Dar es Salaam has grown from a quiet Zaramo fishing village into a thriving tropical metropolis of over four million people. Straddling some of the most important 
            sea routes in the world, it is East Africa's second-busiest port and Tanzania's commercial hub. Despite this, the city has managed to maintain a low-key, down-to-earth feel. 
            Dar es Salaam's architecture is a mixture of African, Arab, Indian and German, although much of this is now dwarfed by towering high-rises. Many travellers bypass 'Dar' completely; 
            those that linger will encounter the city's eclectic cultural mix and languid vibe.</p>
