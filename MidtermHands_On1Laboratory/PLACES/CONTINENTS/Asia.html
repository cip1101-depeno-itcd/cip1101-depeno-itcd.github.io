        <p>Spend all day with your guide exploring Manila, using the public transport systems in the city. This avoids traffic jams that the city is well known for and allows the traveller 
            more of an insight into lifestyles of the Filipino in Manila. Highlights of the tour include Rizal Park, named after the national hero Dr. Jose Rizal, and Intramuros (walled city) 
            where you can see the remains of the Spanish conquistadores. You also go along the old cobbled streets to visit San Agustin Church, the oldest stone church in the country.</p>

        <p>Fashion- and technology-forward but also deeply traditional, this dynamic city mashes up palaces, temples, cutting-edge design and mountain trails, all to a nonstop K-Pop beat.
            Over the last decade Seoul has worked hard to soften its industrial hard edges into an appealing urban ideal of parks, culture and design. Glass, concrete and steel are crafted 
            into natural forms at the spectacular Dongdaemun Design Plaza & Park and City Hall. The popularity of the beautifully landscaped parks alongside the central Cheong-gye stream and 
            the Han River has spurred on the creation of more green spaces and cycle routes.

        <p>Japan is one of the most popular travel destinations for the region. Japan maintains a strong sense of traditional and cultural history while also being a world leader in innovative 
            technology and fashion. Tokyo, in particular, is an exciting and bustling city that boasts a wide range of activities. Here are eight reasons why you should pick Tokyo for your next 
            vacation.</p>

        <p>As an ancient capital, Beijing has preserved many aspects of traditional Chinese culture very well: Beijing opera, kung fu, tea culture, paper cutting, Chinese calligraphy, 
            sugar painting… If you are interested in these, you can experience them at their best in Beijing. Beijing's religious culture is also rich including Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity 
            (Protestant and Catholic), and Islam — the Four Religions of China. Lama Temple is the largest Tibetan Buddhist temple outside of Tibetan areas in west China, White Cloud Temple is 
            Beijing's most famous Taoist temple, Chongwenmen Church is the largest Methodist church in Beijing, and Beijing Niujie Muslim Mosque is the oldest Islamic site in Beijing.</p>

        <p>Taipei is a friendly city whose allure lies in its blend of Chinese culture with a curious fusion of Japanese, Southeast Asian and American influences. Taipei's oddness is one of its 
            charms. It may be inspired by the kawaii (cutesy) culture of Japan, but there's a lot of home-grown humour in there, too. In the puppet museum you will find a strip-tease marionette; 
            the idea of chocolate sauce on a steak is nothing out of the ordinary; themed restaurants transport you to a world where hotpot is slurped from a toilet bowl; and a park installation 
            invites you to cycle a stationary bike whose pedals power an eerie-sounding pipe organ.</p>

        <p>Founded over 1000 years ago, Vietnam's capital city is rich in history, with the streets of its rambling Old Quarter dating back to the 14th century. Wandering these tree-lined lanes 
            past crumbling colonial facades will transport you back in time. However, today's Hanoi is about much more than the past. The ancient city is being invigorated with modern cafes, 
            world-class restaurants, and cool art galleries. When the sun goes down, you have your pick of watering holes, from sophisticated rooftop bars to buzzing bia hơi.</p>

        <p>Bangkok is everything you'd expect from the capital of Thailand: it's noisy, crowded, colorful, exciting, infuriating, and smile-inducing. There are temples, ancient sites, and other 
            attractions to be visited, as well as modern shopping malls that have a kitschy yet high-end ambience. Bangkok can be overwhelming, but it's also a fascinating city that represents 
            Southeast Asia's tension between the developed and developing worlds.</p>
