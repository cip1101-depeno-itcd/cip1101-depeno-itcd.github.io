        <h2>SKILLS</h2>
        <p><blockquote> I am a very <strong>committed</strong> person, when I decide <em>I'm a man of my words and there is no turning back</em>.<sup>1</sup> That kind of committed person both on work and myself committed to <em>finish the 
            tasks</em> that was given to me and the task I needed to be done by myself.<sup>2</sup> Then the <strong>Hard-Working</strong> comes in I always do my best to <em>have an output on something far more better
            than the output of either others or past</em>.<sup>3</sup> Doing much as possible work for a day to release the energy I have everyday, and not to put it into a waste.<sup>4</sup> I tend to be 
            <strong>enthuisaistic</strong> person, some <em>new learnings that given to me is like a new candy that I should have a taste</em>.<sup>5</sup> I spend a lot of time on this interesting learnings I can get
            to every person and I would love to hear it and have either opinions and some idea for it.<sup>6</sup> With me as an <strong>easy-going</strong> person I really don't panic that much and as they say
            <em>go with the flow</em>, just like that the problems and arguments will pass.<sup>7</sup> When someone is with me I always remind him/her to relax and not stress everything else, everything 
            is done on the <em>right time and place we just have to be patient</em>.<sup>8</sup> I am a <strong>creative</strong> person I can deal with it in a creative way, what I mean is not just doing it for me to finish 
            the task but I can manage it with some creativity.<sup>9</sup> For example when the project is dealing with drawing or arts I can really give <em>creative ideas, or brands like their brand names,
            the brand itself</em> I can give such ideas to make this things work and appealing.<sup>10</sup> I'm also skilled in sports particularly <strong>table tennis</strong>, which I practiced alot with varsity players.<sup>11</sup>
            Also I learned from the mistakes of losing to varsity players, what I did is I joined table tennis as my sport to <em>hone my skills on playing it</em>.<sup>12</sup> Until I reach the point I can beat
            varsity players, and win some medals for my team.<sup>13</sup> I also have <strong>positive attitude</strong> towards projects and works, I tend to not stress myself.<sup>14</sup> I always have this when I know one of 
            my groupmate is having trouble on doing his/her part, so <em>be kind and ask them how what is there status this would also give them a boost from what they are doing</em>.<sup>15</sup> <strong>Collaborative</strong> on 
            teamwork projects, I tend to be <em>more active when it comes to collaborative projects or involves brainstorming to other people</em>.<sup>16</sup> I get to express my ideas and my opinion on every 
            aspects of the project the group is doing.<sup>17</sup> I can also <strong>calliraphy</strong> well I'm doing calligraphy since grade 10 until I graduated Senior High.<sup>18</sup> It became my skills that every work I do 
            in <em>school projects I am assigned to make a calligrpahy</em>.<sup>19</sup> Now the recent skills I have is about <strong>computers</strong>, particularly on the side of <em>customizing and fixing some basic errors of software
            and a bit of hardware</em>.<sup>20</sup> Particularly I tend to repair my laptop most often because it is old and needed some care, and to also my younger sister's laptop.<sup>21</sup> I also have a <strong>taste skills</strong>, what 
            I mean about taste skills is that <em>I can differentiate the flavors or needed to add in a food</em>.<sup>22</sup> I am always assigned in the house to taste the food that they are cooking, because I can 
            taste which are the ingredients to be added more or to make the food taste balance.<sup>23</sup></blockquote></p>

        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        <p><blockquote> Hobbies are playing <strong>basketball</strong>, <strong>baseball</strong>, <strong>volleyball</strong>, <strong>table tennis</strong>, <strong>pool</strong>, <strong>bowling</strong>, <strong>cycling</strong>, 
            <strong>calligraphy</strong>, <strong>playing video games</strong>, <strong>working out</strong>, <strong>eating</strong>, <strong>listening to music</strong>, and <strong>watching movies</strong>.<sup>1</sup> The sport basketball is where I made a <em>lot of friends</em>,
            this is the sport where I typically play the most because it's also the majority people love to play also.<sup>2</sup> I reached to the point
            where I spend all my day playing basketball.<sup>3</sup> One time I played 12 hours of basketball, I forgot to go home and eat 
            after I got home at night my parents yelled at me instantly for not even coming home just to eat lunch and dinner.<sup>4</sup> For volleyball this sport
            was the first time <em>I losed in a twice to beat championship</em>, but it was really fun at the same time even we losed two times.<sup>5</sup> Table tennis
            is my first time playing it in highschool but consistenly played it for <em>two years</em> in a row where I won a championship round and a 2nd place,
            I can say this is the <em>most skills I have playing table tennis</em>.<sup>6</sup> I wanted to join the varsity team for table tennis but
            I was not allowed that time to go home at night.<sup>7</sup> Pool or what we call billiards is special for me I played it when there is 
            a free time or at night me my <em>brother and cousins</em> just head into a billiards place then there we enjoy playing it together.<sup>8</sup> Bowling is a hobby 
            with my family that makes us together <em>both happy and fun while playing this game</em>.<sup>9</sup> Cycling was the hobby I had in the pandemic where it is 
            not allowed just to go to mall and hanging out to places, so we decided to do this as a <em>routine with my friends</em> where we visited common places
            near us.<sup>10</sup> Calligraphy was the hobby I do when <em>I'm bored in school every lunch break</em> I just continously write calligraphy in my notebook until
            I notice that <em>my notebook was full of calligraphy rather than notes</em>.<sup>11</sup> Also I tried earning a bit of money doing calligraphy to my classmates,
            whenever they need a bit of a twist on their titles or words they came to me for a calligraphy.<sup>12</sup> Playing video games was my <em>stress relief</em>, everytime
            I <em>overthink</em> or <em>feeling nervous</em> I play video games so that my focus is not too much on what I'm thinking and so that my mind would relax itself
            so it will not lead to stress or overeating.<sup>13</sup> Playing video games became <em>coping mechanism</em> everytime I really need something out of the problem, 
            it's like my rest time everytime I play.<sup>14</sup> Working out was the only way I get myself healthy even when school hours is very long, for the past year 
            I always <em>quit</em> working out.<sup>15</sup> Until I really focused on it not just a hobby but a lifestyle in my life, it releases all my stress and help me on the bad days.<sup>16</sup>
            Working out save me for not being lazy all day and do things that are productive so that I can be consistent on my everyday routine that helped me 
            to use my <em>time wisely</em>.<sup>17</sup> Last would be eating, I love eating and my favorite is <em>chicken</em> any food that has chicken would always be good for me.<sup>18</sup>
            I eat nonstop per day even eating at one or three in the morning, also when going to the mall I really don't even think of things I want to buy
            for me its just to eat I want.<sup>19</sup> I love music for <em>relaxation</em> and <em>self-control</em>, mostly <em>acoustic songs</em> are my favorite ones.<sup>20</sup> Because acoustic songs
            are very slow and haromonic to hear in guitars and piano, and I just listen to songs that are only may favorite.<sup>21</sup> It's so seldom for me to find 
            or choose other songs to listen too, I listen to music whenever I do something or when I'm cleaning my room or the house. Watching movies I have my own genre, more specifically
            on the <em>action</em> side.<sup>22</sup> I like <em>fiction stories</em>, <em>sci-fi movies</em> and a little bit side of a <em>romance</em>, movies are just great to watch everyday it just a better story telling for me 
            rather than reading story books.<sup>23</sup> The favorite movie I like is <em>avatar</em> not the cartoon avatar but the number 1 blockbuster movie of all time that's the avatar I'm talking about.<sup>24</sup></blockquote></p>

        <h2>INTEREST</h2>
        <p><blockquote> Interest in learning and becoming good at playing <strong>chess</strong> is what I'm facinated right now, because of it <em>critical thinking</em> and <em>fast pace playing of chess</em>.<sup>1</sup>
            Particularly I'm playing <em>chess online</em> and I get to be challenged by different players in that server.<sup>2</sup> I am also interested in <strong>interior design</strong>, <em>designing room</em> 
            became my interest because when I redecorate my room after that nonstop of redocarating was done just too make my room <em>comfortable</em> and <em>elegant</em> for me.<sup>3</sup>
            I'm interested in the study of <strong>space</strong> and <strong>time</strong> anything that have theories or talk about the <em>universe</em> itself, it is the best topic to talk about for me.<sup>4</sup>
            It really facinate me how the universe and everything works and how balance life is, from our point of view to the world's point of view.<sup>5</sup>
            With my hobby listening to <strong>music</strong>, I am interested in learning <strong>guitar</strong> so that when I want some music or some relaxation in mind I would just get my guitar
            and <em>play the songs I love</em>.<sup>6</sup> With the mix of learning <strong>singing</strong> so that not just music but with a <em>vocalist</em> a two in one interest that would complete me for the day.<sup>7</sup>
            I am passionate and interested in <strong>animals</strong> especially <em>pets</em>, I want to <em>save</em>, <em>take care</em> and <em>love the animals</em> they are in need of to be loved and to be taken care of.<sup>8</sup>
            In the future hoping to have this interest of saving them and having an <em>organization</em> or <em>shelter</em> for every pet animals that are being saved and to be treated with love and 
            care.<sup>9</sup> I am also interested in <strong>speed typing</strong> recently I've been practicing how to type faster and more <em>efficient</em> by doing online typing challenges.<sup>10</sup> Sometimes I play a game 
            that involves fast typing, it increases my <em>reflexes</em> and the way I read the sentences and typing it.<sup>11</sup> Especially I'm studying a course that involves a lot of typing of codes,
            where typing fast would be more <em>efficient</em> for a short span of time given to code this and that.<sup>12</sup> I am now trying and studying a bit of how to <strong>repair some hardware and software</strong> problems 
            in a <em>computer</em>, <em>phone</em> or any <em>electronic devices</em>.<sup>13</sup> It gives me a lot of energy after <em>fixing</em> or finding the problem with the devices that is being held to me, where even my laptop I tried
            every possible solution to fix it.<sup>14</sup> But in the end I ended up to asking help for a professional to fix the problem, because school has started and I was just borrowing my mom's laptop.<sup>15</sup>
            Also interested in <strong>customizing or organizing laptop or phone interfaces</strong> where it will be more <em>appealing</em> and <em>easier to use</em>.<sup>16</sup> After my brother taught me on things to customize and which are 
            to be on and off for the settings of a laptop.<sup>17</sup> Now I just expand my knowledge through experimenting on different settings which is better for the person who uses it, and up until now
            still convincing my younger sister that I would customize her laptop and the settings so that it would be easier for her and much more clean.<sup>18</sup> I am also interested to <strong>cook my own food</strong>, not
            just a normal cooking I want it to be both <em>healthy</em> and <em>yummy</em> for me.<sup>19</sup> Since I'm working out and wants a great results it should be blended with the nutrition food I eat in a day, to give 
            energy on my workouts.<sup>20</sup> I have also interest in learning <strong>drawing</strong>, I'm trying my best to make my drawings <em>real</em> but sometimes I overthink it.<sup>21</sup> I was so interested in drawing I wanted to <em>pursue</em> 
            it as an everyday life just drawing, but sometimes I can't see myself creative enough to make a piece of artwork.<sup>22</sup> But maybe in the future drawing would be the best decision I could make 
            if that ever happens, art is just so different for some people's point of view.<sup>23</sup> Then I have an interest in <strong>history</strong>, namely history of the <em>country</em>, the <em>place</em>, the <em>vintage item</em> anything that 
            has interesting history.<sup>24</sup> It would just lift me up and it fascinates me to hear and listen to whatever history the person or the television I'm watching even <em>aliens</em> I'm very interested.<sup>25</sup>
            Knowing the fact that there are <em>thrillions of stars</em>, <em>planets</em> and <em>galaxies</em>, this just give me a mind blowing and also great to have a information about it.<sup>26</sup></blockquote></p>
