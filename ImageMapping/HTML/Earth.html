    <p><blockquote>Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the sun. It is a water world with two-thirds of the planet covered by water. 
        Earth's atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen and it is the only world known to harbor life. Earth rotates on its axis at 1,532 feet per second 
        (467 meters per second) — slightly more than 1,000 mph (1,600 kph) — at the equator. The planet zips around the sun at more than 18 miles per second (29 km per second).</blockquote></p>
