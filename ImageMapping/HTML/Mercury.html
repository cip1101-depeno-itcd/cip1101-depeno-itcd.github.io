    <p><blockquote>Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the smallest planet in the solar system, it is only a little larger than Earth's moon. Mercury zips around the sun in only 88 days 
        and because it is so close to our star (about two-fifths the distance between Earth and the sun).Mercury experiences dramatic changes in its dayand night temperatures. Mercury temperatures 
        can reach a scorching 840 F (450 C) in the day, which is hot enough to melt lead. Meanwhile, on the night side, temperatures drop to minus 290 F (minus 180 C). Mercury's atmosphere is very thin 
        and primarily composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium and potassium. Because the atmosphere is so thin it cannot incoming meteors, its surface is therefore pockmarked with craters, 
        just like our moon.</pre></blockquote></p>
